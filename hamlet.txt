  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Ham. The King my father?
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Ham. But where was this?
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here  
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ham. I will.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ham. O God!
  Ham. Murther?
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
  Ham. So be it!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Ham. Between who?
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
    not off.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome-
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Ham. Why,
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Ham. Why,
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
    Get you a place.
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Ham. Nothing.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Ham. As woman's love.
  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
  Ham. If she should break it now!
  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
    world.
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
    the puppets dallying.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
  Ham.   A whole one I!
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
    musty.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
  Ham. I pray you.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
    You go not till I set you up a glass
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
    The King is a thing-
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
  Ham. At supper.
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
    the guts of a beggar.
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
  Ham. For England?
  Ham. Good.  
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
    grave-making?
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
    sense.
  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Ham. What woman then?
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Ham. Why?
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Ham. How strangely?
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Ham. This?
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
    rawer breath
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
    much approve me. Well, sir?  
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
  Ham. In happy time.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
